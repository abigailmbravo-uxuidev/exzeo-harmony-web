# Cypress

## This is the README for testing harmony-web via Cypress
### If you only want the docker container - for CI purposes, e.g. - scroll [here](#Docker-Readme).

This document assumes you have already read the README for Harmony 
[here](https://bitbucket.org/exzeo-usa/harmony-web/src/master/) and followed all steps listed there.

Run `npm run cypress` to test with the test runner,
or `npm run cypress -- --headless` to run in headless mode.

## Builds

### Local
To run it locally, just run the app locally: `npm run start`. Cypress will default to testing here when running `npm run cypress`
or `npm run cypress -- --headless.`

### HIT
To run using HIT, first follow the HIT directions
[here](https://issuecenter.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SDLC/pages/577634574/Running+HIT).
